## Why here?
I found jupyter notebook a good IDE/or practice platform for data science but was got stuck during the installation of IJulia for Jupyter Notebook in windows system. So I searched and reached up to here, it would take a google account only in the name of prerequisite


## Use julia_in_colab.ipynb notebook for the same, as given steps

### how to get the environment running:
1. Downlaod and Upload the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/speedhot/Julia-Programming-for-Data-Science/blob/master/julia_in_colab.ipynb) to your colab environment or you can create your own without mistakes
2. Open the and run  first cell
3. first: is to cell to install Julia and IJulia
4. You have to work in this notebook only for Julia as google colab is not naturally provider of Julia
