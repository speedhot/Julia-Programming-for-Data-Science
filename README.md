## Why here?
I found jupyter notebook a good IDE/or practice platform for data science but was got stuck during the installation of IJulia for Jupyter Notebook in windows system. So I searched and reached up to here, it would take a google account only in the name of prerequisite


## you need to use this (julia_in_colab.ipynb) notebook for the same, as given steps

### how to get the environment running:
1. Upload the [Jupyter notebook]
Open the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Dsantra92/Julia-on-Collab/blob/master/julia_on_collab.ipynb).
2. You can either download it or view it directly on Google Colab.
3. Run the first cell to install Julia and IJulia.

#### Note to the user

Since Google does not directly offer Julia-based computing you, have to take care:

- You need to **work from the same notebook** to get access to a Julia 1.3 kernel.
- You might lose connection to the host and, after re-connecting, you might lose your Julia packages that were installed. To tackle this situation, re-run the first cell and proceed with the follow up instructions in the notebook.
- If you want to create your own notebook, I suggest you use this as a base notebook to work from.

## Contributing
I received help from a lot of people on the [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) and [Slack](https://slackinvite.julialang.org/). It is because of them this notebook is possible. I want to thank these communities and encourage you to participate in them.
